# projectEncrypt
projectEncrypt is an open source identity verification app that allows users to prove their identitiy using a government issued ID. IDs are used for verification, but none of the information is stored. The only information stored for a user is their username, password, and email/phone number. The project was created to combat bot accounts by providing a safe way to prove human identitiy.


## Image Pre-Processing
The project uses [OpenCV](https://link-url-here.org](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) for computer vision to detect the [MRZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport) (Machine Readable Zone) on an ID document. 

Images undergo various stages of pre-processing to detect the location of the MRZ:

## Optical Character Recognition

Once detected, text is extracted from the MRZ using a [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) model, which is trained on a [dataset](https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/tesseractMRZ/tree/master/tessdata_best) of 7000 samples.
